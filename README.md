# Credpal Landing Page
This is a responsive and interactive landing page I built using React (Vite), JavaScript, HTML, and Tailwind CSS. Itâ€™s designed to simulate a modern fintech platform with smooth interactions, reusable components, and a fully responsive layout. Through this project, I demonstrated my skills in component-based architecture, managing state, and using Tailwindâ€™s utility-first styling to create a clean and engaging user experience.
